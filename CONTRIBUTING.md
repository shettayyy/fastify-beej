# Contributing to Fastify Beej

Thank you for choosing Fastify Beej and helping us be better at what we do. It is much appreciated. Read this guide carefully to avoid unnecessary work and disappointment for anyone involved.

## Getting started

Setting up your environment is pretty straight forward:

- Follow all the steps under [Usage](https://github.com/rashtay/fastify-beej#usage)
- Learn the basics of **Git** and **GitHub** if you haven't already
- Create a new feature/bug branch from the `develop` branch. For example, let's say you are working on the FAQ page. Then, create a branch named `feature/faq`. If it's a bug you are resolving on the page, it can be `bug/faq`
- Work in the newly isolated branch
- Commit your code.
- Raise a pull request to merge to `develop`
- Once your code is merged to `develop`, raise a pull request to merge to `main`
- Make sure your isolated branch is always in sync with `develop` i.e merge the `develop` branch with the your branch regularly to keep your branch in sync with the develop branch to avoid merge conflicts while raising a pull request (PR)
